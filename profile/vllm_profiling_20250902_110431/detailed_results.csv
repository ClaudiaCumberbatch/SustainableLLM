A train travels 360 miles in 3 hours.
At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 240 miles?
To solve this problem, we must first determine the rate of travel.
The rate of travel can be determined by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time traveled.
In this case, the total distance traveled is 360 miles, and the total time"
